Here's my ClassChat System.
In this zip you will find 2 folders.
	#1 contains my solution with a client with the group and offline bonuses completed.
	#2 contains the same files from number one, along with my attempted at securing the messages. The only problem is that I used RSA so you can't send a larger message. I didn't have time to create a proper RSA + AES hybrid solution.

	
In each folder, there is server py file along with a client py file. Run the server once, along with as many clients as you need.

Thank you.
